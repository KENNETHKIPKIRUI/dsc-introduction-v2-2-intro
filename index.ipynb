In this lesson, we'll outline the lifecycle of a typical data science project - from business understanding through data visualization.\n","\n","Objectives\n","You will be able to:\n","\n","Describe the full data science process\n","The Data Science Process\n","There is much more to data science than just selecting, applying and tuning Machine Learning algorithms. A data science project will often include the following stages:\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","In this section, you will go through each of these stages and see what is involved.\n","\n","Business Understanding / Domain Knowledge\n","Before trying to solve a data related problem, it is important that a Data Scientist/Analyst has a clear understanding of the problem domain and the kinds of question(s) that need to be answered by their analysis. Some of the questions that the Data Scientist might be asked include:\n","\n","How much or how many? E.g. Identifying the number of new customers likely to join your company in the next quarter. (Regression analysis)\n","\n","Which category? E.g. Assigning a document to a given category for a document management system. (Classification analysis)\n","\n","Which group? E.g. Creating a number of groups (segments) of your customers based on their monetary value. (Clustering)\n","\n","Is this weird? E.g. Detecting suspicious activities of customers by a credit card company to identify potential fraud. (Anomaly detection)\n","\n","Which items would a user prefer? E.g. Recommending new products (such as movies, books or music) to existing customers (Recommendation systems)\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Data Mining\n","After identifying the objective for your analysis and agreeing on analytical question(s) that need to be answered, the next step is to identify and gather the required data.\n","\n","Data mining is a process of identifying and collecting data of interest from different sources - databases, text files, APIs, the Internet, and even printed documents. Some of the questions that you may ask yourself at this stage are:\n","\n","What data do I need in order to answer my analytical question?\n","Where can I find this data?\n","How can I obtain the data from the data source?\n","How do I sample from this data?\n","Are there any privacy/legal issues that I must consider prior to using this data?\n","\n","\n","Data Cleaning\n","Data cleaning is usually the most time-consuming stage of the Data Science process. This stage may take up to 50-80% of a Data Scientist's time as there are a vast number of possible problems that make the data \"dirty\" and unsuitable for analysis. Some of the problems you may see in data are:\n","\n","Inconsistencies in data\n","Misspelled text data\n","Outliers\n","Imbalanced data\n","Invalid/outdated data\n","Missing data\n","This stage requires the development of a careful strategy on how to deal with these issues. Such a strategy may vary substantially between different analyses depending on the nature of problems being solved.\n","\n","\n","\n","Data Exploration\n","Data exploration or Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps highlight the patterns and relations in data. Exploratory analysis may involve the following activities:\n","\n","Calculating basic descriptive statistics such as the mean, the median, and the mode\n","Creating a range of plots including histograms, scatter plots, and distribution curves to identify trends in the data\n","Other interactive visualizations to focus on a specific segments of data\n","\n","\n","Feature Engineering\n","A \"Feature\" is a measurable attribute of the phenomenon being observed - the number of bedrooms in a house or the weight of a vehicle. Based on the nature of the analytical question asked in the first step, a Data Scientist may have to engineer additional features not found in the original dataset. Feature engineering is the process of using expert knowledge to transform raw data into meaningful features that directly address the problem you are trying to solve. For example, taking weight and height to calculate Body Mass Index for the individuals in the dataset. This stage will substantially influence the accuracy of the predictive model you construct in the next stage.\n","\n","\n","\n","Predictive Modeling\n","Modeling is the stage where you use mathematical and/or statistical approaches to answer your analytical question. Predictive Modeling refers to the process of using probabilistic statistical methods to try to predict the outcome of an event. For example, based on employee data, an organization can develop a predictive model to identify employee attrition rate in order to develop better retention strategies.\n","\n","Choosing the \"right\" model is often a challenging decision as there is never a single right answer. Selecting a model involves balancing the accuracy and computational cost of the analysis process. For example, some recent approaches in predictive modeling such as deep learning have been shown to offer vastly improved accuracy of results, but with a very high computational cost.\n","\n","\n","\n","Data Visualization\n","After deriving the required results from a statistical model, visualizations are normally used to summarize and present the findings of the analysis process in a form which is easily understandable by non-technical decision makers.\n","\n","Data visualization could be thought of as an evolution of visual communication techniques as it deals with the visual representation of data. There are a wide range of different data visualization techniques, from bar graphs, line graphs and scatter plots to alluvial diagrams and spatio-temporal visualizations, each of which will work better for presenting certain types of information.\n","\n","\n","\n","Summary\n","In this lesson, we looked at the end-to-end Data Science process to give a sense of the activities that Data Scientists engage with."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Problems Data Science Can Solve\n","GitHub RepoCreate New Issue\n","Introduction\n","In this lesson we will look at what data science is and the different kinds of problems that it can be used to solve.

Before we dig into the details of the tools and techniques that you'll need to learn, it's important to take a little time to understand what you'll be able to do once you graduate. Here is a list of some of the common types of business problems data scientists are expected to solve.\n","\n","1. Regression: How much or how many?\n","Regression analysis is used to predict a continuous value - such as the number of staff you'll need for a busy shift or the likely sale price of a house.\n","\n","Example: Sales or Market Forecasts\n","\n","\n","Traditional trend analysis only looks at how one business entity changes with respect to another. Regression analyses can provide insight into how an outcome will change when several other variables are modified.\n","\n","2. Classification: Which category?\n","Classification is used to predict which category something will fall into. If you're trying to figure out whether a client is likely to default on a loan (i.e., default or no default) or which of your products a customer is likely to prefer, you're dealing with a classification problem.\n","\n","Example: Credit Rating\n","\n","\n","Credit card companies receive hundreds of thousands of applications for new credit cards every week. These applications contain detailed information on social, economic, and personal attributes of applicants. Classification analysis can allow companies to categorize these applications based on the quality of their credit.\n","\n","3. Anomaly detection: Is this weird?\n","Anomaly detection is a common data science technique used to find unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior. It has applications across various industries from intrusion detection (identifying strange patterns in network traffic that could signal a hack) to fraud detection in credit card transactions to fault detection in operating environments.\n","\n","Example: Identifying Fraud\n","img\n","\n","This approach focuses on finding outliers in the data that appear to have unusual patterns. This serves as a first indication of the presence of fraudulent activity. Such approaches are also frequently applied by large social networks like Facebook, Twitter, etc.\n","\n","4. Recommender systems: Which item would a user prefer?\n","Recommender systems are one of the most popular applications of data science today. They are used to predict user preferences towards a product/service. Almost every major tech company (Amazon, Netflix, Google, Facebook) has applied them in some form or the other. You might have noticed phrases like \"If you like this product, you may also like ...\", \"Users who bought this item also bought ...\", and \"Based on your preferences, we recommend following products to you ...\". You got it, these are all recommender systems in action.\n","\n","Recommender systems can help a business retain customers by providing them with tailored suggestions specific to their needs. They can help increase sales and create brand loyalty through relevant personalization. When a customer feels as though they are understood by your brand, they are more likely to stay loyal and continue purchasing through your site. According to a recent study by McKinsey, up to 75% of what consumers watch on Netflix comes from the company’s recommender system. Retail giant Amazon credits recommender systems with 35% of their revenue. Best Buy decided to focus on their online sales, and in 2016’s second quarter they reported a 23.7% increase, thanks in part to their recommender system.\n","\n","Summary\n","While you're going to learn to use a wide range of tools and techniques throughout this course, most of them will be used to predict a continuous value, to decide the most likely category for a value, to identify anomalies or to provide recommendations."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Setting up a Professional Data Science Environment - Introduction\n","GitHub RepoCreate New Issue\n","Introduction\n","If you want to become a professional data scientist, it’s important to take a little time to “set yourself up for success” by installing and learning to use the right tools on your computer.\n","\n","Objectives\n","You will be able to:\n","\n","List some tools used by professional data scientists, and why they are useful\n","What Tools do Professional Data Scientists Use?\n","Python - There are many languages that can be used for data science, but these days most data scientists are using Python to write their code.\n","Jupyter Notebook - Most of those data scientists use Jupyter Notebook for writing their Python code.

As you work on different projects, you may also find that you use different versions of different libraries for different projects. The most common versioning issue is that some projects will run in Python 2 whereas others will run in Python 3, but you may also find that different projects depend on different versions of libraries like Tensorflow.\n","\n","Occasionally, code that works in an old version of a library won’t work in a newer version. So if you open up a new project and install the dependencies, it’s possible that your old project won’t work anymore.\n","\n","To avoid that problem, a best practice is to use “virtual environments”. Virtual environments allow you to have different versions of Python and different versions of the various libraries you use, so you can install a new version of a library for one project but still use the old version for another project. It’s almost as if you have multiple computers that you can swap between, each having a different setup and configuration, just by running a couple of commands.\n","\n","There is a built-in virtual environment feature in Python, but we’re going to use the more flexible virtual environments provided by Conda as part of the Anaconda distribution you installed.\n","\n","To use a new virtual environment, there are two steps you need to complete. The first step is to create the virtual environment. That may take a couple of minutes as your computer has to download the necessary version of Python and all of the libraries that you want to be able to use in that environment. The next step then is to “use” the virtual environment by activating it.\n","\n","If you want to learn more about Conda environments, have a look at the documentationLinks to an external site., otherwise, let’s give this a try.\n","\n","Creating the Conda Virtual Environment\n","You need to start by navigating into this project folder. If you run pwd to print your working directory in your terminal, you should be inside the folder we cloned down. If the name of the current working directory is not \"dsc-data-science-env-config\", then you need to move into that folder - follow the steps above.\n","\n","The instructions to create the environment are slightly different for MacOS and Windows, because they need to use different environment files, so make sure you follow the instructions relevant to your operating system.\n","\n","MacOS: run conda env create -f mac_environment.yml\n","\n","Windows: run conda env create -f win_environment.yml\n","\n","Depending on the speed of your computer and your internet connection it may take up to twenty minutes for this to complete.

Just remember that you've likely just set up learn-env to activate by default, so you'll need to either change that or activate other environments manually when needed.\n","\n","Configuring your Kernel and Confirming your Configuration\n","Jupyter Notebooks run \"kernels\" - the computational engine used for executing your code. It's important to be running the right kernel within your notebook, otherwise you may get errors stating that you don't have a particular package or have the wrong version of it or even complaints about the version of Python you're running (some packages don't support Python 3.8, for example).\n","\n","Right now, let's check that everything is running properly. In your terminal, run jupyter notebook. This should prompt a new browser window to open, at an address that is something like \"localhost:8888\".\n","\n","\n","\n","We'll talk a lot more about Jupyter Notebooks later on in the course, because you'll use them quite a lot! For now, we want to check not only that the terminal shortcut you just used to open a Jupyter Notebook worked, but also that you are running your learn-env kernel in your notebook.\n","\n","You should be able to see learn-env as an option in two places:\n","\n","When you create a new Jupyter Notebook, by clicking \"New\" on the right-hand side\n","\n","\n","Once you're in a notebook or create a new one, by checking the options under \"Kernel\" in the top menu bar\n","\n","\n","If you don't see the learn-env option in those two places:\n","\n","Close the notebook in the browser\n","Close down the notebook server from the terminal\n","(run ctrl + c and then type y to confirm that you want to close down jupyter)\n","In the terminal, enter\n","conda activate learn-env\n","python -m ipykernel install --user --name learn-env --display-name \"Python (learn-env)\" \n","That will add the learn-env to your list of kernels. When you restart the Jupyter Notebook server and try again, you'll be able to select the learn-env option in those two places above.\n","\n","It will be essential to run conda activate learn-env every time you start a new terminal window if you do not set your terminal to activate that environment by default. If you don't do this you will get errors, so please check this first. You can always run conda info --envs to see which environment is selected - and, if you run the above steps to set the learn-env to open by default, you won't need to remember to activate every time you open your terminal.\n","\n","Summary\n","Congratulations!

Luckily, you've already set up a professional data science environment, and in this lesson you'll learn how to actually run your code on your local machine instead of through Illumidesk!\n","\n","The Command Line\n","In order to be able to work locally, we first need to tell you a tiny bit about command line. On Mac computers, this is the terminal application. On Windows computers, we'll use \"Git Bash\". The command line serves as a low-level interpreter through which you, the user, can send commands directly to the computer. As a computer user, you previously have probably sent commands to the computer through a graphical user interface (GUI) such as a web browser, text editor, photo editor, or any other of the myriad of computer programs now in existence. While the command line is initially daunting with its cryptic looking text, we will quickly see some of the many advantages it can have.\n","\n","One of the many useful features of the command line will be using git to clone (download) a local copy of the curriculum hosted on Canvas. This will allow you to work offline and to save changes as you work through exercises and start programming!\n","\n","To start, for Mac users, open the terminal application, for Windows, open “Git Bash”.\n","\n","pwd\n","The first command to try out is pwd which stands for print working directory. This will tell you where you currently are in the computer's directory structure. Try it out.\n","\n","cd\n","The next essential command is cd which stands for change directory. This allows you to navigate to different folders on your computer's hard drive. Typing cd by itself (or cd ~) will automatically take you to your home directory. Typing cd and a folder name will take you to that folder. Typing cd .. will move you one folder up in the hierarchy. Play around and trying moving between folders for a minute or two.\n","\n","Tab Completion\n","An extraordinarly useful feature when working with the command line is tab completion. This allows you to hit the tab button to autocomplete names once you have made a unique specification.\n","\n","For example, if you navigate to your root directory by running the command cd, if you're on a Mac, you will probably have 2 folders within your root directory named \"Downloads\" and \"Documents\" (these are standard folder names created by default in most systems, although you may have renamed them, or your system may be different). With these, or longer folder names, it can sometimes become cumbersome to type the full folder name. instead, you can start typing the command and folder name such as cd Dow and then press tab to autocomplete. Like magic, the command line should complete the statement correctly to be cd Downloads. (Note: this will not work if you have another folder that begins with \"Dow\". Similarly, if you just typed cd D or cd Do followed by tab, the command line will not autocomplete, as the selection is not unique, because D or Do could both refer to either Documents or Downloads. Also note that these commands are case sensitive, and folder capitalization much be matched exactly.\n","\n","ls\n","Continuing with navigating the computer's hard drive, it's useful to know how to list files. This is done with the ls command, short for list.\n","\n","You can also pass optional parameters to ls such as ls -a which lists all files (including hidden files), ls -l gives a long listing of files (including file size and last edit times). You can also pass multiple parameters simultaneously, such as ls -al to produce a detailed listing of all files.\n","\n","* the wildcard parameter\n","Also very useful is the wildcard parameter. For example, if you wanted to list all files in the current working directory that begin with a, you could type ls a*. Here, the asterix (*) denotes anything is allowed following the a. Similarly, to list all pdf files in the current working directory you can use ls *.pdf, or to list all text files, you can use ls *.txt.\n","\n","mkdir\n","Finally, as you continue to navigate the file directory from the command line it can be useful to be able to create new folders. To do this, use the mkdir command, which stands for make directory. Try it out with mkdir NewFolderName. Afterward, use the ls command to see that there is indeed a new folder, and if you wish, move into the new folder using the cd command.\n","\n","Cloning GitHub repositories and Canvas lessons\n","You have already read a little bit about GitHub and how it's used to share code. Since you can now navigate the file directory using the command line, you're ready to download some course materials from GitHub to your local environment. In practice, you will do the following:\n","\n","Fork the course material repository: Forking is the process of making a personal copy of the Canvas course materials on your own GitHub account.\n","\n","Clone the forked course material repository: Cloning is the process of downloading a repository from Github onto your personal computer.\n","\n","Don't worry if this process seems a little confusing. It will be explained in more detail soon. For now, you can just follow the steps below:\n","\n","Create a folder on your computer for your course materials and navigate into it\n","You may also want to create a subfolder titled \"phase_1\" and navigate into that\n","Return to your web browser and navigate to the lesson you want to download\n","Click the GitHub icon\n","\n","\n","You'll be redirected to the associated GitHub repository.\n","\n","Click the fork button, as shown, in order to create a copy to your personal account which you can edit and update\n","\n","\n","One of two things will happen. Either it'll pop up a modal (window) and if you scroll to the bottom of it you'll see it says that you already have a fork. If that's the case, just click on the link to view your existing fork.\n","\n","If you don't already have a fork, you'll be redirected to your new personal copy of the repository:\n","\n","\n","\n","Finally\n","Press cmd + L to highlight the url bar and cmd + c to copy the url (whenever we use cmd to refer to holding down the command key on a Mac computer, on a Windows computer, hold down the control key instead)\n","Return to the terminal (you should be in your course materials folder or your \"phase_1\" subfolder)\n","Type: git clone and paste your repo url (cmd + v for Mac; for Windows, in git bash, shift + insert)\n","Et Voila! The repository and all of its contents will be downloaded locally to your computer!\n","Remember that you need to cd into the new repository once you've downloaded it\n","The next step is to open your Jupyter Notebook locally (not on Canvas/Illumidesk) using the command line\n","Starting the Jupyter Notebook\n","Make sure to activate your conda virtual environment in your terminal first by typing source activate learn-env. Then type jupyter notebook in your command line and press enter. Next, your default browser will open a new window or tab and you will see the list of files that are in your current directory (remember you want to be in the GitHub repo directory that we just downloaded).\n","\n","Note: To stop a Jupyter Notebook, go to your command line where the notebook is running and press the control key + the letter c (ctrl+c).\n","\n","Then click on the index.ipynb file which is the Jupyter Notebook we will be using in this and future labs and lessons. This will open a new tab where you will see the same content you saw in IllumiDesk on Canvas!\n","\n","Summary\n","In this lesson, you learned about the command line, cloning GitHub repositorites, and how to work with Jupyter notebooks locally.

You could save a new file every time you make a change, timestamp that file, and place all of those files into a timestamped folder. You could track all of your changes in a spreadsheet with copious notes. Or you could use dedicated version control software. Guess which method programmers use?\n","\n","Objectives\n","You will be able to:\n","\n","Describe the purpose of version control and Git\n","Why Use Version Control?\n","Let's think about the future for a second. It's a year or two down the road, and you're working at your dream job (YAY!). You just deployed a new chat feature for the app you're working on. Suddenly, your boss runs over to your desk: \"Wait! We can't deploy the chat yet! Revert! Revert!\"\n","\n","What do you do? You need to find all of the new code you pushed to the server and delete it. Then you need to find the old code, test it, and re-upload it. So much work to do. Well, since you used version control software, it's as easy as 1, 2, 3. Actually, it's as easy as git reset --hard <commit id>... but we'll get to that later. Using version control is useful because it allows you to easily rollback to a previous version of your application, saving you a ton of extra work and time.\n","\n","There are a lot of advantages to version control. It's a great way to keep a backup of your work, it facilitates collaboration, and it gives you the freedom to experiment and try new things without messing up the code base.\n","\n","Local vs Remote Version Control\n","A local version control system stores all of the information on your computer, locally. This system works great while you work on a project by yourself. However, it becomes cumbersome when you attempt to collaborate.\n","\n","Some organizations use a centralized repository on a company server. Think of a repository as a big folder that stores all of the files of a particular project. It is simply the location where a project's data is stored. Users pull only the files they need to work on from the server. The advantage is that multiple people can collaborate and work on the same project at once. The disadvantage of this process is that a user must be connected to the network in order to work on the project.\n","\n","Which brings us to the third system, a distributed version control system. In a distributed system, all users have a complete copy of the entire repository. This means that you can work on the project independent of any network connection. Upon reconnecting, you can push your changes to the server and merge with the server's repository.\n","\n","Meet Git\n","Git is the distributed version control system we use here at The Flatiron School. Git began in 2005 and has quickly grown to be one of the most widely used version control systems in the industry. Because so many companies use Git, it's important that you get used to working with it.

Then click create repository.\n","\n","\n","\n","You'll see a page like this:\n","\n","\n","\n","This says it all!\n","\n","Here's an explanation of the steps we're going to follow:\n","\n","Create a directory (GitHub doesn't tell you to do this, but we want to organize and contain what we're sending to the web)\n","echo \"# git_practice\" >> README.md: echo is a bash command which will create a markdown file README.md with the text \"# git_practice\"\n","git init: This turns the current directory into a Git repository\n","git add README.md: Now that the current folder is a Git repository from git init, we can add files for Git to track\n","git commit -m \"first commit\": Once files have been added to Git, we commit them. The -m option is for leaving a comment which is required\n","git remote add origin url_goes_here: By default, git does not have to be connected to an online platform like GitHub. You can use Git locally for version control too. There are also other online Git platforms like Bitbucket and GitLab. Here, you're adding a link to GitHub's online hosting so that you can also sync your work with the cloud. This is super handy for sharing your work with others, collaborating, or any of the other reasons why cloud services are used\n","Again, now that you have an overview, let's have at it!\n","\n","Create a new directory for your repo\n","Open up your command line (mac: terminal, windows: git bash)\n","Navigate to the appropriate directory such as /Documents/Flatiron/Module_2_Git_Bash (or however you plan to organize your course materials)\n","Create a new folder for this lesson mkdir git_practice\n","Navigate into your new folder\n","cd git_practice\n","\n","Initialize this folder as a git repository\n","git init\n","\n","Create a README\n","echo \"# git_practice\" >> README.md as described works perfectly well\n","Alternatively, if you're feeling adventurous, you can try a text editor such as nano, vim, or emacs\n","If you're going the adventurous route, try nano README.txt for now and then type \"# git_practice\" in the file. Press \"Ctrl+X\" to quit and press \"Y\" to confirm you wish to save your changes\n","Git Status\n","While not required, let's get familiar with what's going on with git status.\n","\n","Git Add\n","Add your file. You can use git add README.md or git add --all (if there were multiple files, you would add all of them).\n","\n","Git Status\n","Again, not required but helpful to get familiar with everything. Try it again and note the difference: git status.\n","\n","Git Commit\n","Now that we've added the files, we're ready to finalize them to our version history. Commit them with git commit -m \"your message here\".\n","\n","Add a Remote Location\n","Again, remember that Git itself is a version control system that can be used anywhere. GitHub is an online hosting platform allowing us to take Git repositories to the cloud to share and collaborate. By adding a remote location, we are able to sync our work between online and offline and collaborate with others. The origin is simply a default naming convention symbolizing that the online version will be the central source of truth for this repository.\n","\n","With that, we can set it up with\n","\n","git remote add origin the_url_for_the_repo\n","\n","Generally, it's easiest to simply copy and paste from the code provided by GitHub.\n","\n","Pushing our changes\n","We've already added our README.md file to Git and commited the changes. While these changes are present and up to date (take a look at git status again), they are not reflected online yet as we haven't synced our updates with our online version. To do this, type git push origin master.\n","\n","If you are wondering what master is, it's the name of our branch. You can use branches in git to seperate versions of code from each other. A common example comes from web development for production environments. The master branch usually contains the working code for the website or app in production, and then other branches can be created for developing updates and new features, while not breaking the current working version. master is the default branch for all Git repositories, and we'll take a further look into branches in general in the upcoming lessons.\n","\n","Previewing Changes\n","Now that you've pushed your changes online, refresh the GitHub page. You should now see a little page like this:\n","\n","\n","\n","Congratulations! You just created your first Git repository!\n","\n","Summary\n","In this lesson, we continued to practice our bash skills with the command line and started practicing our version control skills with Git. We created our first Git repository from scratch, and practiced adding, commiting, and pushing those changes to GitHub."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## .gitignore\n","GitHub RepoCreate New Issue\n","Introduction\n","So far our examples have assumed that we want Git to track changes to all files in our repository. In some cases, we want Git to ignore certain files, and this is accomplished using a .gitignore file.\n","\n","Objectives\n","You will be able to:\n","\n","Describe use cases for a .gitignore file\n","Interpret and utilize the glob syntax of a .gitignore\n","Use Git and .gitignore to ignore files that Git is currently tracking, or to track files that Git is currently ignoring\n","Why .gitignore?\n","If version control systems like Git are designed to track all of your changes, why would we want to tell it to ignore some files? There are three main reasons:\n","\n","Private files\n","Irrelevant files\n","Files that are too large for GitHub\n","Private Files\n","Breezeicons-actions-22-view-certificate\n","\n","In some cases, you will need credentials in order for your code to access some service. This includes free services! For example, if you are using a rate-limited API, the API needs to know who is making the request in order to determine whether you have exceeded your limit of requests.\n","\n","These credentials are often stored in the form of keys or secrets, often stored in JSON or YML file formats.\n","\n","You want to avoid pushing these files to public GitHub repositories, because people have set up bots to crawl GitHub in order to steal these valuable credentials!\n","\n","Using .gitignore you can make sure that your credentials are not pushed.\n","\n","Irrelevant Files\n","Breezeicons-actions-22-noisereduction\n","\n","Some of the files generated in the process of coding are not actually relevant for future users of the repository.\n","\n","These include:\n","\n","Log files\n","Notebook checkpoint files (e.g. .ipynb_checkpoints from Jupyter Notebook)\n","OS-specific files (e.g. .DS_Store, which is only applicable to Mac computers)\n","Configuration files for code editors (e.g. .vscode, which is used by VS Code)\n","If you are working with collaborators, not only are these files not useful to them, they can actually cause merge conflicts!\n","\n","Files That Are Too Large for GitHub\n","Breezeicons-actions-22-project-development-close\n","\n","GitHub limits the sizeLinks to an external site. of files that can be pushed to its repositories. If you try to push a file that exceeds the 100 MB threshold, you will get an error message and the push will fail.\n","\n","Often in a data science context, these large files are the data files themselves. Sometimes you will find that a compressed file (e.g. .zip file) is small enough to be pushed to GitHub, but the expanded version is too big. Then you can specify the expanded version in the .gitignore while still being able to share the compressed data on GitHub.\n","\n",".gitignore Syntax\n","Now that we understand some reasons that we might want to ignore certain files, how does that actually work?\n","\n","To start with, you put a hidden text file called .gitignore at the root of the repository. It is hidden because it starts with ., which means that in order to view it you will need to type ls -a rather than just ls in the terminal. We demonstrate the .gitignore in this very repository below:\n","\n","!ls\n","CONTRIBUTING.md  index.ipynb  LICENSE.md  README.md\n","!ls -a\n",".   CONTRIBUTING.md  .gitignore   .ipynb_checkpoints  README.md\n","..  .git         index.ipynb  LICENSE.md\n","Basic Syntax\n","The file's content is just a list of things to ignore, as well as whitespace and comments (which start with #). The items in the list are separated by newlines.\n","\n","For example, this could be the contents of a valid .gitignore file:\n","\n","# a comment\n","secrets.json\n","\n","# another comment\n","secrets.yml\n","This means that if the repository contained a file called secrets.json and/or a file called secrets.yml, Git would ignore them.\n","\n","Glob Syntax\n",".gitignore can also work with wildcard characters using glob syntaxLinks to an external site.. For example, if you wanted to ignore all files ending with .csv, the .gitignore might look like this:\n","\n","# ignore all CSV files\n","*.csv\n","Or, if you only wanted to ignore only CSV files in the data/ folder, that might look like this:\n","\n","# ignore CSV files in the data/ folder\n","data/*.csv\n","For more examples with comments, see the Git documentationLinks to an external site..\n","\n","Useful Defaults\n","The examples above were specific to a particular project, and you will typically need to write your own .gitignore lines for these specialized use cases.\n","\n","Outside of these narrow use cases, there are resources available for developing .gitignore files that are appropriate for your type of project in general. For example, GitHub maintains a Python .gitignore templateLinks to an external site. (this can be added to your repository by selecting it from the drop-down when you initialize a repository on GitHub). There is also a tool called gitignore.ioLinks to an external site. that will help you identify useful .gitignore lines for your operating system or code editor. It's usually a good idea to use these resources first, before trying to write your own glob syntax!\n","\n","Ignoring a Tracked File\n","If you previously used git add on a file then ran git commit, that means that the file is already tracked, regardless of what the .gitignore says.\n","\n","Irrelevant Files\n","If the file is just irrelevant for your collaborators, you can tell Git to stop tracking it. For example, if you wanted to tell Git to stop tracking log.txt, you could use this command:\n","\n","git rm --cached log.txt\n","Note that this is a command you run in the terminal, not a line to be added to the .gitignore file. For the changes to be reflected on GitHub, you will also need to run git commit and git push.\n","\n","In general git rm is a useful command that deletes a file from the directory and stages that file deletion with Git (i.e. combines the rm file_name and git add file_name steps). Adding --cached to git rm means that Git will no longer track the file, but that the file will not actually be deleted from the directory.\n","\n","(You also probably want to add that file name to the .gitignore at the same time!)\n","\n","Private or Too Large Files\n","If the file is private/secret or too large for GitHub, you will need to rewrite your Git history. This can be fairly complicated (see this blog postLinks to an external site. for more details) so it's always better to add things to .gitignore sooner rather than later!\n","\n","Telling Git Not to Ignore\n","Many developer setups will include a global .gitignore fileLinks to an external site.. This file is not located within a specific repository, and can be especially useful for OS-related settings (e.g. ignoring .DS_Store on a Mac).\n","\n","Sometimes you might want to override these global settings for the current repository, particularly if your global .gitignore is relatively broad. To do that, you use the same glob syntax, placing a ! at the beginning.\n","\n","So, for example, if you want Git not to ignore log.txt in a particular repository, you could add this to the .gitignore:\n","\n","# do not ignore log.txt\n","!log.txt\n","Summary\n","Sometimes you want Git to ignore certain files. The common reasons for this are that the files are private, the files are irrelevant to collaborators, or that the files are too big for GitHub. To tell Git to ignore the files, you use a hidden file called .gitignore at the root of the repository. This file uses glob syntax to specify which files should be ignored, including * to indicate a wildcard and ! to indicate that a file should not be ignored. We recommend that you use useful defaults rather than writing your own .gitignore lines most of the time, and that you always make sure to add private or too-large files to the .gitignore as soon as possible so you don't have to rewrite your Git history."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Collaborating with Git Branches\n","GitHub RepoCreate New Issue\n","Introduction\n","So far we've primarily presented Git as a version control system. Not only is Git a good version control system, it is also a marvelous tool for collaboration and team development. In fact, it was originally designed by Linus Torvalds for coordinating development for the Linux kernel. A primary mechanism through which Git collaboration can effectively be organized is the concept of branches.\n","\n","Two golden practices in collaborating with git are:\n","\n","Keep the master branch functional at all times\n","Keep lines of work ( branches ) separate from each other\n","Let's explore git branches and we'll come back to review why these golden practices are so helpful.\n","\n","Objectives\n","You will be able to:\n","\n","Explain branches and their purpose in git\n","Create a new branch\n","Switch between branches\n","Use git merge to merge different branches\n","Identify and fix merge conflicts when merging branches\n","Define a git branch\n","A git branch is a means to separate a new set of commits or edits from another branch. Typically we create a new branch off of master. If all developers we collaborate with honor golden practice 1, we can trust that master will be a safe starting point.\n","\n","When we branch, we're creating a separate parallel universe. We can experiment there without any adverse effects to the master branch. It's a contained sandbox where mistakes can be made or ideas can incubate.\n","\n","It's an idea that a lot of fiction has presented in the last 50 years.\n","\n","Parallel Universe\tSource\n","Mirror Dimension\tDr. Strange (2016)\n","Darkest Timeline\t\"Community\" / \"Inspector Spacetime\"\n","The entire premise of..\t\"Dr. Who\"\n","Mirror, Mirror (Evil Kirk / Spock)\tStar Trek\n","Plot Against America\tPhilip Roth\n","The entire plot of...\t\"Primer\" (2004)\n","If you understand multiple-timeline fiction, you get the idea of branches.\n","\n","Annie Edison Says Farewhen to the Inspector\n","\n","By working in branches, collaborators can work without messing with the main timeline, known as master. OK, so how can we actually leverage this reality-shattering idea?\n","\n","Create a new branch\n","Let's suppose a master branch with two commits:\n","\n","\n","\n","Best practices suggest that any new set of changes related to fixing a bug, creating a feature, or even messing around with experimental code in a \"sandbox\", should be started on a new branch.\n","\n","In order to start a new branch, type:\n","\n","$ git branch <new-branch-name>\n","This creates a new branch. If you wish to see a list of all branches associated with a git repo, you can type:\n","\n","$ git branch -a\n","In case of a branch relating to writing a new feature, you could name the branch add-preprocessing-and-normalization. Thus: git branch add-preprocessing-and-normalization creates a new branch named add-preprocessing-and-normalization. This will take the entire commit history of the branch you're on (usually master) and make it the same history as on the add-preprocessing-and-normalization branch.\n","\n","At this moment master and add-preprocessing-and-normalization are the same branches / realities etc.\n","\n","Switch to a new branch\n","In order to start making changes on your new branch, you need to \"check it out.\" After checking a branch out, your commits will be added to that branch's history. You move between branches with:\n","\n","$ git checkout <branch-name>\n","Protip: You can create and checkout a new branch in one command using: git checkout -b <new-branch-name>. This will both create the branch new-branch-name and move into it by checking it out.\n","\n","If you are currently on add-preprocessing-and-normalization, you can move back to master with git checkout master. You can also type git checkout - in order to move back to the previous branch.\n","\n","When you add commits to a branch, you can see the history of the commits by typing:\n","\n","$ git log --graph\n","The git log command displays the history of commits for the branch you're on. The --graph \"flag\" tells git to make it pretty, like a timeline. You can use \"Space\" to page down the history of commits. Use q to exit.\n","\n","Let's suppose we added two new commits to our new branch. We could visualize it as:\n","\n","\n","\n","To make sure that you don't lose work, you should make sure all your changes are committed before you switch branches. If you're doing work in add-preprocessing-and-normalization that updates model.py, because master also has a model.py file, master could overwrite your changes. Make sure all your changes are committed before you switch branches.\n","\n","Advanced: git has a powerful feature called stash which can be used when you're ready to hold changes-in-progress. When you're very comfortable with git, look into it!\n","\n","As you add more commits on the new branch you're changing only the add-preprocessing-and-normalization reality. The master branch will not be changed.\n","\n","You can confirm this by first checking out master using git checkout master, then use git log --graph again, and you can see that the master branch only has the code up to the moment you \"branched\" into the add-preprocessing-and-normalization timeline, er, branch.\n","\n","The code from add-preprocessing-and-normalization is safely tucked away in that branch, waiting patiently in isolation from the rest of your code in master until the feature is considered complete. Let's talk about merging these commits into master.\n","\n","Merge a branch into master\n","Now that you have some additions to the code that you'd like to combine back with the master, the goal is to bring the commits that occurred on the add-preprocessing-and-normalization branch into the master branch. By merging the branch, master will have all of the commits from the add-preprocessing-and-normalization branch as though those events occurred on the master branch.\n","\n","When merging a branch with git merge, it's important to be currently working on your target branch, the branch that you want to move the content to of the new branch.\n","\n","The first step for our add-preprocessing-and-normalization merge is to checkout master because that is where you want the commits to end up. You can then use git merge <branch-to-merge> -m \"message\" like shown here:\n","\n","$ git checkout master\n","$ git merge add-preprocessing-and-normalization -m \"merge in the feature\" \n","Now the branches have been merged. If you type git log --graph, you'll see the commits from the add-preprocessing-and-normalization branch on your master branch.\n","\n","Here's another way to visualize it:\n","\n","\n","\n","In this graphic, you might note that a commit happened to master between the two commits that made up our feature branch. The amazing thing is git reconciles the master timeline, the additional commit, and the commits in this feature branch. It re-weaves multiple realities together. That is seriously cool.\n","\n","When you're done with a branch that's been merged you can delete it with:\n","\n","$ git branch -d <branch-to-delete>\n","Merge conflicts\n","Occasionally, when merging two branches, you might run into a message similar to this:\n","\n","Auto-merging <filename>\n","CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <filename>\n","Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result. \n","What happened here? Well, you made changes to the same file (<filename> in this case) on both the base and the feature branches, and now Git doesn't know which set of changes to retain. In order to resolve this, you need to manually fix the relevant file. To do this, first open the relevant file. After opening the file, you will see conflict markers -- <<<<<<< HEAD, =======, and >>>>>>> branch-name. These markers indicate which portions of the file have conflicting changes. The markers and the conflicting changes are represented like this:\n","\n","...\n","...\n","everthing is fine here\n","<<<<<<< HEAD\n","...\n","...\n","this is the portion from the destination branch\n","=======\n","...\n","...\n","this is the portion from the source branch\n",">>>>>>> branch-name\n","All the lines between <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= are the conflicting lines from the base branch and all lines between ======= and >>>>>>> branch-name are the conflicting lines from the <branch-name> branch. Here you can discard the set of conflicting lines of your choice and then delete the conflict markers (<<<<<<< HEAD, =======, and >>>>>>> branch-name). After you do this, add and commit your changes so you can merge the branches without any issues.\n","\n","Note: If there are multiple conflicts in the same file, each conflict is surrounded by conflict markers and it is your resposibility to resolve each conflict individually and remove all the conflict markers before you attempt to merge again.\n","\n","Keep your local repo up to date\n","When you are collaborating with several people on a project, it is important that you are always up to date with the changes others are making to the project. Not only will this ensure that you are always working with the latest version of the project, but it will also help reduce merge conflicts!\n","\n","Thus your local branches can merge in changes from remote repository branches just like they can do for local branches! To update a list of available branches at a remote we use: git fetch <remote-name>. Note this only updates the list of branches from remote repositories and not the local branches themselves. If you want to update the local branches, you have to merge. To give you a preview of what merging a remote branch workflow looks like:\n","\n","$ git fetch origin \n","$ git checkout add-preprocessing-and-normalization \n","$ git merge origin/laurens-preprocessing \n","And now our local add-preprocessing-and-normalization has Lauren's ideas woven into it.\n","\n","Alternatively, as a shorthand, you can fetch and then automatically merge the same-named branch from the remote using git pull <remote-name> <branch-name-to-merge-in>.\n","\n","Explain the motivation of the \"Golden Practices\"\n","As developers we try to make sure that everyone has a clean place to start from: be that for writing a new feature or fixing a bug. Branching lets us keep master working at all times. If an emergency bug comes up, we know we have a solid foundation to build from. Feature branches also help us look at git log and see what the intention of a feature was.\n","\n","Summary\n","Git is a complex tool, and these tools are just scratching the surface for collaborating with people. These workflows are just being introduced to you -- and it may be challenging for the time being. You'll have lots of time to practice them and get used to what each command does.

Sometimes, workflows aren't quite as linear or straightforward as those examples we've discussed thus far. For example, if both the local and remote versions of a repository have been updated at the same time, you may encounter merge conflicts! Essentially, Git is unsure of which changes to incorporate if both versions of the repository have changed the same line of the same file.

Execute git stash apply.\n","\n","You should be presented with a message:\n","\n","Auto-merging numbers.py\n","CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in numbers.py\n","What's more, if you open up numbers.py with nano numbers.py, you'll see some bizarre changes:\n","\n","\n","\n","So what do all of these symbols mean?\n","\n","<<<<<<< Updated Upstream - the beginning of the original branch (beta)\n","======= - the end of the original branch/the beginning of the branch being merged in (our stashed changes)\n",">>>>>>> Stashed changes - the end of our stashed changes\n","This is because our new branch and the stashed changes modified the same line of the same file. Specifically, both modified line 2 of the numbers.py file. As such, Git is unsure of which version of line 2 we wish to incorporate. It has highlighted this for us, and it’s now our job to manually modify the file to resolve these conflicts, keeping the version we are interested in.\n","\n","As a further note, this is why development would generally be separated by files, or at the very least, sections of files; we can avoid merge conflicts and continue to collaborate together working seamlessly on a project.\n","\n","Your numbers.py file should now be back to numbers raised the 4th degree as such:\n","\n","for i in range(10):\n","    print(i**4)\n","(To do this, we simply manually opened up the file with nano and resolved the merge conflicts, including removing the notes left for us by Git.)\n","\n","Checking git status, we now see that we have once again modified numbers.py.

This can be helpful if the remote repository has been updated and you first need to fetch and pull it, but have already also made some changes locally. In this and other cases, it's often easiest to first just stash the changes and then apply them subsequently. Similarly, we also saw that stashed changes can be applied to multiple branches. Overall, the more you use Git and its myriad of tools, the more options you'll have for organizing and synchronizing your development process."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Bash and Git - Recap\n","GitHub RepoCreate New Issue\n","Introduction\n","In this section you took a look at how Git is used for collaboration as part of a development team. This started by practicing navigating directories using the command line and continued by further investigating Git commands. You also practiced creating and maintaining Git repositories including adding, committing, and pushing changes. You saw how to make multiple branches and then merge changes back into the master branch. You also saw how to navigate merge conflicts when the same line of the same file has been edited in both branches trying to be merged. Make sure you continue to head back to the PEP8 and Git documentation for clarification, review, and learn more commands and arguments or style suggestions.\n","\n","Bash and the command line\n","Recall some of our primary tools for navigating the command line: cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, and nano. You can use cd .. to move up a directory level and cd ~/Documents for folders starting at the user's home directory. You can use ls -a to view hidden files and ls -la for a long listing of all files. (Again the l argument is for long form and the a in both cases for all files, including those beginning with ., indicating that they are hidden.) You can also make directories with the mkdir command. You saw how to use nano to make and edit files from the command line. Other editors such as emacs and vim can be worthwhile if you are doing more substantial command line editing.\n","\n","Git\n","Remember that Git was not only designed as a version control system, but a means for collaborative development. It was originally released in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, to help facilitate development of the Linux kernel. While there is still much to learn about Git, you saw some of the primary concepts all developers interact with when using Git to collaborate on projects.\n","\n","Git commands\n","You've seen a decent amount of Git commands including git add, git commit, git branch, git checkout, and git merge. Also its important to know how to access documentation so that you can both review and extend your knowledge. For example, to see a list of git commands in general, start with git --help.\n","\n","\n","\n","You can also review individual commands with 'git help ' such as git help add (press q to quit the documentation.)\n","\n","\n","\n","In the synopsis, you can see optional parameters such as in git add --all which you previously used before.\n","\n","Similarly, for the commit documentation, take a look at git help commit (and subsequently use q to quit.)\n","\n","\n","\n","Here, you might notice additional arguments that you can begin to use, such as a, which you see listed in the synopsis. Then, if you look under the options header, you will see a full description.\n","\n","\n","\n","So for example, you could combine this with the m option as git commit -am \"your commit message\". (Indeed this is a useful shortcut; by doing this you can bypass the git add command in your workflow in updating files being tracked by Git.)\n","\n","At some point, you will also run into some trouble with Git and have merge conflicts or other idiosyncrasies between versions of your code. You have seen how Git annotates merge conflicts, and can also use git stash to temporarily store changes.\n","\n","Summary\n","Once again, preliminary tools such as the command line and Git are foundational to managing projects and maintaining code. Similarly, knowing how to access further information quickly is also an indispensable soft skill. Be sure to continue to organize work, modularize, and use version control. Also, keep PEP8 in mind and be thoughtful of how you organize, comment, and structure your code. All of these will make you a better programmer and Data Scientist."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Data Analysis in Base Python - Introduction\n","GitHub RepoCreate New Issue\n","Introduction\n","In this section, you'll continue solidifying your knowledge of Python programming, descriptive statistics, and data visualization by performing key data analysis tasks. You will learn how to load data from CSV and JSON files into Python objects in memory, and wrap up with an analysis that joins together two datasets.\n","\n","Base Python\n","When we say \"base Python\", this means that we are emphasizing the data types and modules that are part of Python itself, rather than using third-party libraries. For much of this course, you will use numerous Python libraries such as pandas and StatsModels, but first we want to dig into how data analysis tasks can be performed without them.\n","\n","Python Data Types and Control Structures\n","In this section, our data is stored in data structures that are built into the Python language: numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc. For example, if we have this table of data:\n","\n","color\tnumber\n","green\t7\n","red\t2\n","orange\t1\n","A standard way we might represent that table would be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row and has the keys color and number:\n","\n","info_table = [\n","    {\"color\": \"green\", \"number\": 7},\n","    {\"color\": \"red\", \"number\": 2},\n","    {\"color\": \"orange\", \"number\": 1}\n","]\n","\n","type(info_table) \n","list\n","\n","Then if we wanted to print out all of the values associated with the color keys, the logic would look something like this:\n","\n","for row in info_table:\n","    print(row[\"color\"]) \n","green red orange\n","\n","In later sections of this course, that same task (printing the list of colors) might look something like this, using the pandas library:\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","df = pd.DataFrame(info_table)\n","type(df) \n","pandas.core.frame.DataFrame\n","\n","print(df[\"color\"]) \n","0 green 1 red 2 orange Name: color, dtype: object\n","\n","In the base Python example, we had a variable info_table which was type list (a built-in Python type), whereas in the pandas example, we had a variable df which was type pandas.core.frame.DataFrame (a custom type from the pandas library).\n","\n","Then to print out the colors, in the base Python example we had a for loop and then code to extract the information from each individual dictionary. The string values got printed out without any additional markup. Then in the pandas example we did not have to use a loop (hint: this is broadcasting like we saw previously with NumPy) and also we had some extra markup where it printed out the index values as well as Name: color, dtype: object.\n","\n","In this section you will practice performing data analysis with the first (base Python) format, before eventually learning how to use pandas instead.\n","\n","Python Modules\n","In addition to the data types used, we will also use built-in Python modules. These modules must be imported, but they are part of Python itself and do not require separate installation.\n","\n","The main modules we will focus on are csv (documentation hereLinks to an external site.) and json (documentation hereLinks to an external site.).\n","\n","import csv\n","import json \n","Loading Data from Files\n","While trivial example data structures like the one above can be declared directly in Python code, more realistic data comes in the form of a file on disk.\n","\n","In this section you will practice opening data files that use the CSV and JSON formats, then loading them into sensible objects using the csv and json libraries in order to perform additional analysis.\n","\n","CSV Files\n","The first major file type we will explore is CSV (comma-separated value).
